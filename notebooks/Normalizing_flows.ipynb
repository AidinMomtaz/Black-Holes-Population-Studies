    "\n",
    "1. “Normalizing” means that the change of variables gives a normalized density after applying an invertible transformation.\n",
    "2. “Flow” means that the invertible transformations can be composed with each other to create more complex invertible transformations.\n",

    "In normalizing flows, we wish to map simple distributions (easy to sample and evaluate densities) to complex ones (learned via data)by applying a sequence of invertible transformation functions. Flowing through a chain of transformations, we repeatedly substitute the variable for the new one according to the change of variables theorem and eventually obtain a probability distribution of the final target variable."
